What is Langchain?
LangChain is an open-source framework for building LLM-powered applications, offering core components like Models (LLM integration), Prompt Templates (structured prompts), Memory (context retention), Indexes & Retrievers (efficient document retrieval), Agents (dynamic decision-making), and Chains (workflow automation). It simplifies RAG applications by enabling efficient document ingestion, retrieval, contextualized responses, and state management using vector databases, embeddings, and intelligent querying. This allows for seamless integration with external data sources and scalable AI-driven search and reasoning systems. ðŸš€

langchain-community â€“ Contains community-maintained integrations and tools for working with various LLM providers, databases, and APIs.
langchain-experimental â€“ Includes experimental and early-stage features for advanced LangChain applications, such as novel retrieval methods and agent capabilities.
langchain-groq â€“ Provides integration with Groq's LLMs, enabling fast and efficient model inference.
langchain-huggingface â€“ Facilitates the use of Hugging Face models (transformers, embeddings, and pipelines) within LangChain
